MEMORY SYSTEM TEST SUITE - SUMMARY
================================================================================

Test 1: PASS - Memory-aware planning: head-with-memory.sh injects decisions & open questions
Test 2: PASS - Anchor extraction: anchor-extract.sh added 5 anchors from test log (19→24)
Test 3: PASS - Reuse stability: Two identical runs produce identical memory context
Test 4: PASS - Action status update: Append-based update works with latest-entry-wins logic
Test 5: PASS - Parallel robustness: 4 concurrent mem-search queries completed without errors

================================================================================
OVERALL: 5/5 TESTS PASSED
================================================================================

TODOS for improvement:
1. Add status= filter to mem-search.sh for action status queries
2. Consider deduplication for action status (latest-entry-wins)
3. head-with-memory.sh could be more explicit about when to reuse vs override decisions
