PASS

Changed: "Test action for status update verification"
Original status: pending (first entry)
Updated status:  done (second entry, most recent)

Verification method: grep for action text, take last entry, check status field.
The test action was added with status "pending", then updated to "done".
The most recent entry correctly shows "done" status.

Note: mem-search.sh currently lacks a status= filter. For production use, consider:
- Adding a status filter to mem-search.sh
- Using latest-entry-wins deduplication for action status queries
