Memory System Test Session - 2025-11-29

Session started at 14:00 UTC.

After reviewing the existing memory architecture, we made several key decisions:

1. Decided to use E5-large-v2 for local embeddings because it offers the best balance of quality and speed for our batch processing needs.

2. Action: Build mem-search helper with filtering support for type, topic, and date ranges.

3. Open question: Is deeper hierarchy worth the complexity? We need to evaluate if 4+ levels of summarization adds value or just introduces latency.

4. Fact: We run on Ubuntu 22.04 with 32GB RAM and an RTX 4090, which allows for local embedding inference.

5. Action: Implement temporal decay in retrieval scoring with configurable tau parameter.

Session ended at 15:30 UTC.
