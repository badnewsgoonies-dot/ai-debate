# Unified Codebase Analysis Summary

## Overview

**AI-Debate** is a collection of pure bash scripts that orchestrate AI-to-AI interactions for debates, collaborative design, autonomous development, and visual verification loops.

## Key Findings

### Structure (Partial - Agent Failed)
The STRUCTURE agent encountered an error due to an invalid model configuration (`gpt-5.1-codex-max` does not exist). Based on CLAUDE.md documentation:

**Main Directories:**
| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `visual-loop/` | Autonomous visual development (edit → screenshot → verify) |
| `architect/` | Collaborative AI design sessions |
| `debate/` | Adversarial AI debates (FOR vs AGAINST) |
| `autopilot/` | User/Developer simulation |
| `guardian/` | Rule enforcement and violation blocking |
| `knowledge/` | Accumulated learnings and session transcripts |

**Entry Points:**
- `visual-loop/auto.sh` - Main visual dev loop
- `visual-loop/orchestrate.sh` - Task pipeline runner
- `architect/architect.sh` - Design collaboration
- `debate/debate.sh` - Debate orchestration
- `learn.sh` - Knowledge accumulation

### Dependencies ✓
All system and AI CLI dependencies documented:
- **System:** tmux, jq, bc, pv, chromium/chrome, perl, git
- **AI CLIs:** `claude` (Anthropic), `codex` (OpenAI with vision)
- No package.json - pure bash implementation

### Quality (Agent Failed)
The QUALITY agent also failed with the same model access error.

---

## Critical Issues

1. **Codex Model Misconfiguration**: The model `gpt-5.1-codex-max` doesn't exist or isn't accessible. This affects any `codex exec` commands in the toolchain.

2. **Untracked Directory**: Git status shows `swarm/` is untracked - should be committed or added to `.gitignore`.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Codex Configuration**: Update to a valid model (e.g., `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, or check OpenAI API access for correct model IDs)

2. **Resolve Untracked Files**: Either commit `swarm/` or add it to `.gitignore`

3. **Add Fallback Handling**: Scripts should gracefully handle AI CLI failures with meaningful error messages

4. **Run Manual Quality Check**: Since the agent failed, manually verify:
   ```bash
   # Check for syntax errors in bash scripts
   shellcheck visual-loop/*.sh architect/*.sh debate/*.sh
   ```
